Personal Blogspot is a blog based responsive web-application created using MERN stack where users can authenticate themselves by registering and then after have access to perform CRUD operations on their own blogs as well as LIKE/UNLIKE other user's blog whereas unauthorized ones can simply check and go through all the blogs.

Modules covered are: 
- User Management
- Blog Management
- Image Upload Functionality
- Like/Unlike Functionality

Routes for users and blogs have been built using REST API. Authentication and Authorization has been provided using Json web token (JWT).
