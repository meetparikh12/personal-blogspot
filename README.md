# personal-blogspot
Personal Blogspot is a blog based responsive web-application created using MERN stack where users can authenticate themselves by registering and then after have access to perform CRUD operations on blogs as well as LIKE/UNLIKE other user's post whereas unauthorized ones can simply check and go through all the blogs.

Routes for users and blogs have been built using REST API. Authentication and Authorization has been provided using Json web token (JWT).
